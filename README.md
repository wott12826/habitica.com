# Habitica UI Clone (Simplified)

This repo contains a lightweight React-based prototype replicating key pages of the Habitica interface. It is focused on the home page, challenges list and FAQ section.

## Getting Started

Open `public/index.html` in a modern browser with internet access. The page loads React from a CDN and renders the `App` component defined in `src/`.

The code is intentionally minimal and does not require a build step.
